Reflection:

In developing my Jungian Dream Interpreter web application, I sought to honor Carl Jung’s insights by creating a tool that acts as a dialogue between the self and the ego. Jung taught that dreams are not mere reflections of the past but serve as guides to extract wisdom from the unconscious, preparing us for the future. My goal was to design a website that respects these ideas by closely matching the user’s input with a thoughtful text interpretation and a corresponding image that illuminates what the dream reveals about the individual, without imposing assumptions.

Drawing on my studies in Jungian psychology, I refined the system prompt used for generating text. Originally, the prompt simply requested a symbolic interpretation based on Jung’s theories. However, this sometimes led to overly elaborate or even negative analyses. For example, when a user provided a prompt like “drinking with my best friend, my girlfriend mad at me,” the model occasionally overinterpreted, inferring unresolved personal issues that weren’t necessarily present. 

To correct this, I revised the prompt to focus explicitly on core Jungian concepts—such as the collective unconscious, archetypes (including the Shadow, Anima/Animus, Self, and the ego), and individuation—while reminding the model that the interpretation is creative rather than diagnostic. In addition, I reduced the temperature setting from 0.9 to 0.7, which produces more measured and balanced responses that shed light on inner conflicts and growth without excessive speculation.

On the visual side, my earlier image prompts led to outputs that were overlayered with symbolic detail. The images, although rich in Jungian symbolism, became clustered and unclear. I addressed this by revising the image prompt to concentrate primarily on the literal elements of the dream, for instance, emphasizing a man building sandcastles with his kids on the beach, while still incorporating subtle nods to Jungian thought. This modification ensures that the generated images remain faithful to the user’s narrative and are aesthetically clear, avoiding the pitfalls of over-symbolism.

A significant technical challenge was posed by the DALL·E API’s 1000-character limit on image prompts. To overcome this, I structured the prompt into two parts: a fixed “start” section containing guiding language rooted in Jungian concepts and a “middle” section that comprises the user’s freeform input. If the combined prompt exceeds 1000 characters, the system automatically truncates the middle section, ensuring that the prompt stays within the API’s limit while preserving its essential content.
Through these iterative improvements, the website now provides users with a balanced, respectful, and insightful interpretation of their dreams—one that aligns closely with Jungian theory while accommodating user freedom and technical constraints.
